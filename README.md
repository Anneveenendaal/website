# Tilburg Science Hub

Tilburg Science Hub (TSH) is an open-source online resource that helps individual researchers, data scientists, and teams to efficiently carry out data- and computation-intensive projects. It provides information about workflow and data management and tutorials that teach researchers how to organize and document their data and code, so the research becomes sustainable and reproducible. This in turn leads to time savings and transparency in the process.

## Why was TSH developed?
We see two major reasons why it pays off to use professional tools to carry out empirical projects. First, the initial investment pays off very quickly. There are many tools that are tremendously helpful and many things can be automated, which also helps to avoid errors. Second, it increases transparency and contributes to reaching the goal of making science reproducible.

## What does TSH offer?
Many of us face the same dilemma. We know that a small investment will have big returns, but we put off making it because we lack the time to make it now. TSH makes it easier to make this investment now by providing:

- information about all one needs to know to get started
- tutorials
- example workflows
- starter code

This makes it much more attractive and fun to start now, because the initial investment becomes even smaller.


## Module: Guide for Bootcamp in Scientific Computing and Reproducible Science

This module is based on a fork of https://pp4rs.github.io/installation-guide,
and we would like to acknowledge Lachlan Deer (`@lachlandeer`) as well as the
Department of Economics at the University of Zurich for their fantastic work
on the original repository.
