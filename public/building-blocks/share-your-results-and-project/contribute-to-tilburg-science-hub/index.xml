      <description>Create a new building block Building blocks are the DNA of our platform. They are small code snippets that users can independently &amp;ldquo;mix&amp;rdquo; to create something unique. Think of building blocks like LEGO bricks - each one with its own color, shape and functionality.
Check out our platform&amp;rsquo;s menu system to see in which categories we classify our building blocks. Want to add a new category? Let us know via a GitHub issue.</description>

      <description>Create a new tutorial Tutorials teach our users how to combine individual building blocks into a &amp;ldquo;final product&amp;rdquo;. What that product really is is your choice.
When creating a new tutorial, you typically realize that you also need to create several new building blocks to make the tutorial work. So if you haven&amp;rsquo;t contributed to our platform yet, try contributing a building block first before starting on a brand-new tutorial.</description>
