Using publicly available data from AirBnB (available via [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston)), we illustrate how a reproducible workflow may look like in practice.

Check out [our GitHub repository for all the details on how to clone the project and run it](https://github.com/tilburgsciencehub/tisem-airbnb).

We've crafted this project to run:

- platform-independent (Mac, Linux, Windows)
- across a diverse set of software programs (Stata, Python, R)
- producing an entire (mock) paper, including modules that
	- download data from Kaggle,
	- prepare data for analysis,
	- run a simple analysis,
	- produce a paper with output tables and figures.
