## Overview
In the social sciences, regresion analysis is a popular tool to estimate relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is a way to find trends in data, quantify the impact of input variables, and make predictions for unseen data.

In this building block, we illustrate how to estimate a model, identify outliers, plot a trend line, and make predictions.

## Code

### Estimate Model
Linear regression (`lm`) is suitable for a response variable that is numeric. For logical values (e.g., did a customer churn: yes/no), you need to estimate a logistic regression model (`glm`). The code sample below estimates a model, checks the model assumptions, and shows the regression coefficients.

* Model transformations can be incorporated into the formula, for example: `formula = log(y) ~ I(x^2)`.
* The coefficients (`coefficients(mdl)`), predictions for the original data set (`fitted(mdl)`), and residuals (`residuals(mdl)`) can be directly derived from the model object.
* A concrete example on how to evaluate model assumptions (mean residuals is 0, residuals are normally distributed, homskedascticiy) can be found [here]().

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
library(broom)

# estimate linear regression model
# to estimate a logistic regression model use:
# glm(formula = y ~ x, data = data, family = binomial)
mdl <- lm(formula = y ~ x, data = data)

# check model assumptions
autoplot(
  mdl,
  which = 1:3,
  nrow = 1,
  ncol = 3
)

# show regression coefficients
summary(mdl)
```

### Identify Outliers
Compute the leverage of your data records and influence on `mdl` to identify potential outliers.

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
library(dplyr)
leverage_influence <- mdl %>%
    augment() %>%
    select(y, x, leverage = .hat, cooks_dist = .cooksd) %>%
    arrange(desc(cooks_dist)) %>%
```

### Plot Trend Line
Plot a scatter plot of two numeric variables and add a linear trend line on top of it.

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = data, aes(x, y)) +
geom_points() +
geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```
{{% /codeblock %}}


### Make Predictions
Given a linear regression model (`mdl`), make predictions for unseen input data (`explanatory_data`). Note that for multiple linear regression models, you need to pass an `explanatory_data` object with multiple columns.

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
explanatory_data <- c(..., ..., ...)

prediction_data <- explanatory_data %>%
  mutate(   
    y = predict(
      mdl,
      explanatory_data,
      type = "response"
    )
  )

# See the result
prediction_data
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

### Export Model Output

Convert regression coefficients of `mdl_1` and `mdl_2` into a HTML file that can be copied into a paper.

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
library(stargazer)

stargazer(mdl_1, mdl_2,
          title = "Figure 1",
          column.labels = c("Model 1", "Model 2"),
          type="html",
          out="output.html"  
          )
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

[This tutorial](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com/docs/building-blocks/regression-analysis/) outlines how to run, evaluate, and export regression model results for the `cars` dataset.  In particular, it analyzes the relationship between a carâ€™s speed and the stop distance.
