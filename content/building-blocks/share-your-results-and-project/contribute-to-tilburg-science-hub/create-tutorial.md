# Create a new tutorial

Tutorials teach our users how to combine individual building blocks into a "final product". What that product really is is *your* choice.

When creating a new tutorial, you typically realize that you also need to create several new building blocks to make the tutorial work. So if you haven't contributed to our platform yet, try contributing a building block first before starting on a brand-new tutorial.

# Start with our tutorial template

<!--
The design should always accommodate all users' knowledge levels and avoid confusion. For instance, on a tutorial page, there should be a quick and concise explanation (a sort of TL;DR), as well as a more in-depth exposition for those who need to educate themselves first.

The design should be attractive and easy to use for all our target groups and should strike a balance between glossiness and nerdiness. We want to avoid unnecessary clutter and stock photos. Let's keep it simple.
