# Create a new building block

Building blocks are the DNA of our platform. They are small code snippets that users can independently "mix" to create something unique. Think of building blocks like LEGO bricks - each one with its own color, shape and functionality.

Check out our platform's menu system to see in which categories we classify our building blocks. Want to add a new category? Let us know via a GitHub issue.
