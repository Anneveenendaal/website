## Overview

An educational video is meant for transferring knowledge to an audience. These often involve animations or presenting a slide deck. However, in most of the cases, you might want to show yourself - or the presenter - talking to the camera.

This guide will focus on the process of making these videos, not the content, and it's aimed at teachers or contributors of Tilburg Science Hub. In other words, we will talk about the technical preparation and equipment needed to record such videos, not on how to create animations or compelling presentations.

This first part deals with equipment. The second part of this guide covers the shooting workflow for production and post-production stages.
