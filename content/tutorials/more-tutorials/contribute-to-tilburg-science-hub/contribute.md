## How to contribute to Tilburg Science Hub

We're glad for your interest in contributing to our project. Tilburg Science Hub is open-source, and as such, **anyone** can contribute! The process is really simple.

You are welcome to contribute to our platform in three different ways. Keep reading to learn which one is the best method for you!

## What is a contribution?

Anything from simple changes, grammar checks and reporting a bug to more elaborate changes and writing entirely new content!

## How is the content organized?

We provide content in three forms:

- **Building Blocks** are concepts in small doses. These allow us to explain the theory while also providing some practical examples and code snippets for a variety of programming languages or operating systems. Information is explained in a way that it is easy to clone or implement in an existing project. While everybody can follow our Building Blocks, they are generally more appealing to advanced users â€“ or those who already know what to look for.

- **Tutorials** explain a broader argument compared to Building Blocks, and follow a sequential order. These are particularly useful for novices or anyone new to a certain topic because of their comprehensive nature and step-by-step guidance. We support and encourage the use of videos, exercises, and quizzes in a tutorial.

- **Examples** are real-life cases, publications, templates, or research projects that put into practice the concepts explained on this website.
