## There's a Better Way

Like in [the first method](../mode-1), you can reach out to us with any request opening an issue on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/tilburgsciencehub/tsh-website). We prefer this method because it allow us to keep track of bugs and requests more easily, to merge duplicates, assign roles, etc...

[Here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) you can learn how to create an issue on GitHub - it's very easy!

Again, feel free to open an issue for **any** kind of feedback and contribution, like:

- general fixes (typos, small sentences)
- elaborate changes (modifying, adding or removing an entire paragraph or chapter)
- asking for new content to be added
- submitting an article without worrying about formatting (even a Word file!)
- reporting a bug
- requesting a new feature on the website
- general tips or questions on the project
