# Development Call

## Getting started

Unlike many of the technical tutorials on the web which teach how to use code for a very specific purpose, Tutorials at Tilburg Science Hub separate case-specific instructions from very general, high-level Building Blocks. Read more about Tutorials and Building Blocks [here](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/contribute).

## Objectives

**Is your content request related to a problem you've encountered during your research process? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. *Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]*

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about your request here.

## Deliverables

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. Choose if you need a Tutorial, a Building Block, both, or more of them. Remove the (potentially) unnecessary one(s) and fill in the information below.
