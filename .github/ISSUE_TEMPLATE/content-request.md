# Development Call

## Getting started

Unlike many of the technical tutorials on the web which teach how to use code for a very specific purpose, Tutorials at Tilburg Science Hub separate case-specific instructions from very general, high-level Building Blocks. Read more about Tutorials and Building Blocks [here](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/contribute).

## Objectives

**Is your content request related to a problem you've encountered during your research process? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. *Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]*

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about your request here.

## Deliverables

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. Choose if you need a Tutorial, a Building Block, both, or more of them. Add new ones by copying the structure below, or remove the unnecessary ones. Lastly, fill in the required information.

- [ ] **A Tutorial:**
  - Purpose: *Ex. Teach our users how to set up a new empirical research project on a local computer...*
  - Motivation: *Ex. Users should not always start from scratch, but use the best principles when setting up and working on empirical research projects because...*
  - Suggested title: *Ex. "Automatically set up a new research project on your computer"*
  - Suggested keywords: *Ex. automation, configure, setup, local *
  - Required tools: *Ex. Python, R, RStudio, Git, Make, LaTeX...*
